Below is a detailed breakdown of the **technical specifications** and **backend logic** for **Tahara**, a Sharia-compliant financial platform built on the Solana blockchain. This response outlines the architecture, components, and integrations necessary to deliver a secure, scalable, and compliant platform that adheres to Islamic finance principles while leveraging blockchain technology.

---

## 1. Technical Specifications

### 1.1 Blockchain: Solana
- **Why Solana?**: Solana is selected for its high transaction throughput (up to 65,000 transactions per second) and low transaction costs (less than $0.01 per transaction), making it an excellent choice for a financial platform requiring efficiency and scalability.
- **Consensus Mechanism**: Solana employs a hybrid of **Proof of Stake (PoS)** and **Proof of History (PoH)**. PoH timestamps transactions to ensure their chronological order, enhancing efficiency by reducing validator communication overhead.
- **Smart Contracts**: Known as "programs" on Solana, these are written in **Rust** and will enforce Sharia-compliant rules for financial operations such as profit-sharing, investments, and rewards.

### 1.2 Backend Framework
- **Framework**: **Node.js** with **Express.js** or **NestJS** is used for its ability to handle asynchronous operations and integrate seamlessly with the Solana blockchain.
- **Database**:
  - **MongoDB**: Stores user profiles, transaction histories, KYC data, and compliance records.
  - **Redis**: Caches frequently accessed data such as asset prices and user balances for improved performance.

### 1.3 Third-Party Integrations
- **Privy.io**: Provides embedded wallet functionality, allowing users to manage funds without external wallet software.
- **Stripe**: Handles debit card issuance and related compliance requirements (KYC mandatory).
- **Moonpay**: Enables fiat-to-crypto onramp and offramp for SOL and other tokens, with built-in KYC support.
- **Jupiter API**: Facilitates token swaps within Solana’s DeFi ecosystem.
- **Dinari.com API**: Offers tokenized stock investments that can be screened for Sharia compliance.
- **Sumsub**: Manages KYC verification to meet regulatory standards.

### 1.4 AI Integration
- **Recommendation Engine**: Utilizes machine learning (e.g., collaborative filtering) to recommend personalized, Sharia-compliant investment and savings options based on user preferences and risk tolerance.
- **Compliance Monitoring**: AI models perform real-time checks to ensure assets and transactions comply with Sharia principles, screening out prohibited activities like interest (riba) or speculation (gharar).

### 1.5 Security
- **Authentication**: **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** with optional two-factor authentication (2FA) for secure user access.
- **Encryption**: **HTTPS** for API communications and **AES-256** for data at rest.
- **Smart Contract Audits**: Conducted regularly (e.g., by CertiK) to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities.
- **KYC/AML**: Mandatory for fiat transactions and card issuance, enforced via Sumsub integration.

### 1.6 Scalability
- **Microservices Architecture**: Independent services (e.g., user management, investments) allow modular scaling.
- **Solana’s Throughput**: Supports up to 65,000 TPS, ensuring the platform can handle significant transaction volumes.

## 2. Backend Logic

### 2.1 User Authentication and Wallet Management
- **Embedded Wallets via Privy.io**:
  - Wallets are automatically generated upon user registration and linked to their accounts.
  - Eliminates the need for an external "Connect Wallet" button; users access wallets via standard login.
- **Authentication**:
  - JWT secures API endpoints, with middleware validating user permissions for sensitive operations.

### 2.2 Blockchain Interactions
- **Solana Web3.js**: A JavaScript library used to manage transactions, call smart contracts, and query on-chain data.
- **Smart Contracts** (written in Rust):
  - **Savings Pool**: Handles profit-sharing deposits, withdrawals, and profit distribution.
  - **Investment**: Manages fund allocation to halal assets and profit tracking.
  - **Rewards**: Issues and redeems tokens based on ethical spending activities.
