# Sanafi Onchain Website Branding and CSS Styles

The Sanafi Onchain website features a distinctive and cohesive brand identity with carefully crafted visual elements. Here's a comprehensive breakdown of the branding and CSS styles:

## Color Palette

The website uses a sophisticated and calming color scheme that conveys trust, ethics, and professionalism:

- **Primary Green (`#1b4d3e`)**: A deep forest green used for primary elements like buttons, logo background, and footer. This color conveys stability, ethics, and reliability.
- **Cream Background (`#e9e1ca` and `#f5f0e5`)**: Warm, soft cream tones create an inviting, clean canvas that feels both modern and timeless.
- **White (`#ffffff`)**: Used for text on dark backgrounds and card elements to create contrast and improve readability.
- **Text Colors**: Various shades of green and gray for different text hierarchies, with opacity variations (text-white/70, text-gray-600) to create visual depth.


## Typography

The website uses the Poppins font family, a geometric sans-serif typeface that balances professionalism with approachability:

- **Font Weights**: Multiple weights (300, 400, 500, 600, 700) for creating clear visual hierarchies
- **Heading Sizes**: Range from text-2xl to text-5xl with responsive adjustments
- **Body Text**: Clean, readable text with appropriate line heights and spacing


## Design Elements

### Islamic/Geometric Patterns

The site incorporates subtle Islamic-inspired geometric patterns as background elements, adding cultural context and visual interest without overwhelming the content:

```css
.islamic-pattern {
  background-image: url("data:image/svg+xml,...");
  opacity: 0.6;
}

.geometric-accent {
  background-image: url("data:image/svg+xml,...");
  background-size: 50px 50px;
  opacity: 0.5;
}
```

### Logo Design

The logo features a minimalist circular design with the letter "S" in the brand's cream color against the deep green background:

```css
.logo {
  width: 150px;
  height: 150px;
  background-color: #1b4d3e;
  border-radius: 50%;
  color: #e9e1ca;
  box-shadow: 0 10px 25px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);
}
```
